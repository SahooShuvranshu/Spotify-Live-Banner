## 🎫 Get Your Spotify Pass (Super Easy!)

Think of this like getting a VIP pass to access your Spotify data. We made it SUPER easy with a web tool!

### 🌐 Use the Web Token Generator (Recommended!)

**No Python or terminal needed!** Just use your browser:

👉 **[Get Token Here](https://spotify-refresh-token-generator.onrender.com)** 👈

**What happens:**
1. 🌐 Opens in your browser (no installation!)
2. 📝 Follow 3 simple steps on the website
3. 🔑 Gets your credentials automatically
4. 📋 Copy and paste them when deploying
5. ✨ You're done!

**Note:** First load might take 30-60 seconds as the server wakes up from sleep mode (free tier). Just be patient! ☕

**You'll get 3 secret keys:**
- `CLIENT_ID` - Your app's name tag
- `CLIENT_SECRET` - Your app's password
- `REFRESH_TOKEN` - Your VIP access pass

---

**"Cloud" just means "someone else's computer that's always on!"** 

Pick your favorite platform (they're all free to start):

### 🟢 Render (Easiest for Beginners!)

## 🎨 Make It Yours (Customization)

Time to make your widget look AWESOME! 🌟

### How to use your widget

Add this to your GitHub profile README (replace `YOUR_URL` with your actual URL):

```html
<!-- Basic widget -->
<a href="https://YOUR_URL/link">
  <img src="https://YOUR_URL/" alt="Spotify Now Playing" width="400" />
</a>
```

### 🎨 Customize with magic parameters!

Add these to the end of your URL to change how it looks:

| What it does | Add this | Options | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 💿 Spinning album | `?spin=true` | `true` or `false` | `?spin=true` |
| 📱 Scan code | `?scan=true` | `true` or `false` | `?scan=true` |
| 🌙 Dark mode | `?theme=dark` | `light` or `dark` | `?theme=dark` |
| 🌈 Rainbow bars | `?eq_color=rainbow` | `rainbow` or any color | `?eq_color=rainbow` |
| 🎨 Custom color | `?eq_color=FF0000` | Hex code (no #) | `?eq_color=FF0000` |

### 🎭 Style Examples

## 🔑 Secret Keys (Environment Variables)

**What are these?** Think of them as your app's ID card and password!

Your app needs these 3 keys to talk to Spotify:

```env
CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id          # Your app's username
CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret  # Your app's password
REFRESH_TOKEN=your_spotify_refresh_token  # Your VIP pass (never expires!)
```

**Where do I put them?**
- On Render/Railway/Vercel: In the "Environment Variables" section
- On Heroku: Use `heroku config:set KEY=value`
- Locally (testing): They're in your `.env` file automatically!

**Pro tip:** NEVER share these keys publicly! They're like your house keys - keep 'em secret! 🔒

---

## 🚨 Help! Something's Wrong!

Don't panic! Here are quick fixes for common problems:

### 😢 "Widget shows 'No Track Playing'"

**Why?** The widget can't see what you're listening to.

**Quick fixes:**
- ✅ Make sure you're actually playing music on Spotify right now
- ✅ Turn off "Private Session" in Spotify (Settings → Social)
- ✅ Use the same Spotify account that made the tokens
- ✅ Wait 30 seconds if your app was sleeping (free tiers)

### 😵 "My tokens don't work!"

**Why?** Something went wrong with the keys.

**Quick fix:**
- 🔄 Visit [Token Generator](https://spotify-refresh-token-generator.onrender.com) again
- 📋 Get NEW tokens and copy them to your hosting platform
- 🔄 Restart your app

### 😱 "Deployment failed!"

**Why?** The platform couldn't build your app.

**Quick fixes:**
- ✅ Make sure Root Directory is set to `Source` (capital S!)
- ✅ Check that all 3 environment variables are filled in
- ✅ Try deleting and re-deploying
- 📖 Read the error log - it usually tells you what's wrong!

### 🤔 "App is slow or not loading"

**Why?** Free tier apps sleep when not used.

**Quick fixes:**
- ⏰ Wait 30-60 seconds for it to wake up
- 🔄 Refresh the page
- 🤖 Use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) (free!) to ping your app every 5 minutes
  - This keeps it awake 24/7!

### 😤 "It was working, now it's not!"

**Common culprits:**
- 🔋 Free tier credits ran out (check your platform dashboard)
- 🎵 Spotify changed their API (rare, but happens)
- 🔑 Your token expired (run the script again)
- 💤 App went to sleep (wait for it to wake up)

**Still stuck?** Open an issue on GitHub! We're here to help! 🤗
